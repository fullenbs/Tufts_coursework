1) I spent around 4 hours on week 1 of the project.

2) I spent about 6-7 hours on week 2 of the project. I feel like the time 
difference is in part due to running into some simple bugs that took me a while 
to notice.

3) I liked the project. The only issue I had with was testing involving
big.testdata. For checking if my results were correct, I would have to
go through the file and manually check what the result would be, which felt 
very tedious.
