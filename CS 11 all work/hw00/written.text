Q1) I'm taking cs11 because I want to learn how to be a better coder and am
also hoping to learn some c++. 

Q2) I  don't currently feel very worried about the course content. Most of the
content we've gone over so far has focused on concepts and commands I'm
familiar with, I've just had to learn some new syntax. 

Q3) I like playing board and table top games. Some of my favorites are Catan
and MTG. I also play the guitar. 

Q4) It took me a little over an hour to complete the assignment.
